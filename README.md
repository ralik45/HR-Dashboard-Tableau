# HR Dashboard Project üöÄ

Welcome to the **HR Dashboard Project**! This repository showcases an interactive HR dashboard built to provide data-driven insights for effective workforce management. The project aims to create a comprehensive tool for monitoring key HR metrics, understanding workforce composition, and identifying trends to support strategic decision-making.

## üìä **Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to develop a dashboard that empowers HR managers with both high-level insights and the ability to perform detailed analysis on employee data. By leveraging a combination of summary views and detailed records, the dashboard addresses critical HR questions related to employee demographics, compensation, and performance.

### **User Story**

As an HR manager, I want a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

## üîç **Analyze Requirements**

The dashboard is divided into two main views:

1. **Summary View**:
   - **Overview**: Provides a snapshot of overall HR metrics
   - **Demographics**: Offers insights into workforce composition
   - **Income Analysis**: Focuses on salary-related metrics

2. **Employee Records View**:
   - Comprehensive list of all employees with detailed information

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Data Preparation**

The dataset includes various attributes such as Employee ID, Gender, State, City, Department, Job Title, Hire Date, Termination Date, Education Level, Performance Ratings, Overtime Status, and Salary.

1. **Data Generation**: Used a custom Python script to create synthetic data reflecting real-world HR scenarios.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Checked data types, handled missing values, and ensured data consistency.
3. **Calculated Fields**: Created calculated fields for metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Building Charts**
